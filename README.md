## 🧠 How It Works

- The game board is a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take alternate turns placing "X" or "O".
- JavaScript checks for:
  - Winning patterns in rows, columns, and diagonals
  - A draw (no empty cells, no winner)
- A message is displayed when a player wins or the game is drawn.
- A reset button allows replaying the game.
